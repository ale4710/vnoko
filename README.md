# VNoko
"<u>V</u>isual <u>N</u>ovel <u>o</u>n <u>K</u>ai<u>O</u>S"

a vnds interpreter for kaios.

## download stable version
not yet available.

if you'd like to try it just download the entire repo.

## novel structure
place novels in the folder

    .vnoko/novels/

if there is an archive in the game folder, e.g. `background.zip`, it is *recommended* that you extract it. it is not required - if you really dont want to extract it then dont.

if there is both a folder and a archive, e.g. there is both `script/` and `script.zip`, the archive will only be loaded. please choose one or the other.

if you have a novel with a lot of files, e.g. a fully voiced game, scanning will take a long time - it will stay in "starting" for a long time. please be patient, it take take up to ten minutes.

## save files
save files are compatible with the Nintendo DS version of VNDS!!*\**

you can copy your novels, saves and all, to your kaios device and vnoko can see you save files just fine!

however, the other way around, saves in slots 17~99 (or something like that) will not be seen by VNDS. otherwise it will work.

*\*barely tested*
